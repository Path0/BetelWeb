<div class = "boyScouts">
    <img class = "images" src = "Philmont.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">This is my Boy Scout troop at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. I am an Eagle Scout, and I enjoy rigorous adventures such as this, 
        where our group hiked over 35 miles over 7 days, including climbing Mount Baldy, pictured in the top right.

<div class = "dog">
    <img class = "images" src = "Casey.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">This is my dog, Casey! He is a golden retriever, is 10 years old, and is VERY energetic. One thing he does that
        we all love is that he always sits under the table with us during dinner.

<div class = "robot">
    <img class = "images" src="Robot.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">I am part of Carmel High School's robotics team, the TechHOUNDS. Pictured is last year's robot which we built throughout the third
        nine weeks. I am in the Robot Ops division, which is in charge of building the robot's frame and designing all of the mechanisms that make it perform tasks. 
        It is a large time commitment, but it is very fun!

<div class = "family">
    <img class = "images" src = "Train.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">This is my family! I am an only child, and I am adopted, so it's just me, my mom, and my dad. We like to travel, in this picture we are in Asheville, 
        North Carolina before a train ride through the hills. When I was younger (and still to some degree today), I loved trains, how they worked, the history, 
        and I even had a few model train sets from Lionel.

<div class = "me">
    <img class = "images" src = "Me.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">Hey look, it's me! I'm Andrew, a senior at Carmel High School. I lived in Broad Ripple until I was about 4 1/2 years old, 
        when my family moved to Carmel, where I have lived ever since.</p>

<div class = "piano">
    <img class = "images" src = "Piano.jpg" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">I have played the piano for about 11 years now, and I love improvisation and jazz, but I like to figure out any song by ear and add my 
        own twist to it! I have had the amazing opportunity to play at the Palladium for the Music for Miracles concert for two years in a row. I record some songs that I compose 
        and post them to YouTube occasionally so I can remember which is which.

<div class = "bike">
    <img class = "images" src = "Bike.PNG" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">Don't worry, I was being safe in that picture. Well, as safe as I could be with my bike on fire a few feet away from me. 
        I like engineering various projects in my garage that range from motorized bicycles to RPG firework launchers to a homemade welder. Whenever 
        I have an idea, I like to explore it.

<div class = "CBC">
    <img class = "images" src = "CBC.png" draggable = "false">
    <p class = "textContent">I am the president of the Computer Building Club, now the Community Computer Repair Club 
        at CHS. CCRC is a charity club that repairs broken computers and gives them back to families that need them. I enjoy working with computers, servers 
        (the thing in my basement called Beetlejuice that you're seeing this webpage off of), networks, and everything IT. I also like coding, I know and often use 
        Java, Python, HTML, and CSS.
