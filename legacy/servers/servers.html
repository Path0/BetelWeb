            as of now it's just a sandbox server running on gm_london.
            also there's like 230 addons so beware the load time and 
            try not to be dissapointed because i told you what it was,
            the server name is literally "there's a lot of addons" 
            anyways some of the addons are as follows: <br/><br/>
            Tardis, Tardis Rewrite, A ton of train things, SCars, Advanced Duplicator
            Doors, Better Weapons.

            it's vanilla minecraft, 1.16.1. not much else to say.
            i don't plan on ever resetting the map but just continually bodging it 
            to try and make it work but nothing you build is gonna get deleted 
            so don't worry about that. (the world size is already well over 5GB). with the new 1.16 update, 
            i have not reset the nether, so you might have to go a ways out before you reach new terrain.

            BeetleMod Minecraft Server. fancy, right? not really. anyways, the mods are <a href = "BeetleMod v1-1.zip">here</a> so download 
            them and put them into your mods folder to play. 
            the version of forge mod loader we use is 1.12.2 - 14.23.5.2854. 
            <a href = "https://adfoc.us/serve/sitelinks/?id=271228&url=https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2854/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2854-installer.jar">here</a> 
            is the link to download forge, just click "install client" and hit enter and you're good to go. I recommend 
            giving the game<!-- HA YOU LOST THE GAME SUCKA --> at least 8GB of ram, 
            but with lowered settings you can survive with less.

            the ip for this server is

            Good job! You found the web server by typing beetlejuice.us into chrome and chrome 
            alone if you use any other browser i will personally come to your house and stalk you until you use chrome 
            </br>
            Anyways, the web server is mainly used for storing data and knowing how old i am in days. you can access the ftp server anonymously by 
            clicking the link on the website, but you can only download the files shown, not edit them  or put your own in. there really isn't too 
            much reason anybody but myself should use it because i'm just going to use it for school work so i can access stuff from home and at school 
            more easily. i may add more pages to the website but for now the five you see on the nav bar are gonna stay.
