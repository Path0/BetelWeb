			so this is beetlejuice. not sure what I'm gonna do with this webste but this is here for now. i'm running a couple dedicated servers on this thing, i think i'll make a page for that sometime soon who knows. I'll mostly just use this as a dumping ground for all my stuff, i might make a redirect to cbc if i ever get around to making a website for that.
