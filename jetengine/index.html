regardless, i have much to show you. you see while you were at kronak i decided to chronicle my experiments and observations into a journal.
i call it, <i>The Anarchist Cookbook 2</i>. apparently there was another one written hundreds of years ago during the
"war with the trees that spoke vietnamese". that's all i could find on the subject through the Alknowing One.

in your "existence".
