    <p>
        So, imagine you're me. 1 week from graduating high school. You have about 20 missing assignments to catch up on.
        Not fun, right? Last night I knew I was going to stay up to try and do homework, but I realized that I couldn't use 
        the printer's scanner without waking my parents up. I found a video last night about finding "michaelsoft binbows," 
        it was a video essay about the research that someone did to find a place seemingly lost by the internet. 
        <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzAAjzbV5g">here</a>'s the link if you want to watch it. Highly reccomend.

    </p>

        Anyways, the video featured a japanese blog that had been running for 33 years, by a man who documents just about everything. 
        That blog inspired me to make this, becuase I generally like to document the things I do, usually by keeping physical items 
        or copies, or rarely, by taking pictures. I think putting this up on my website will allow the things I do to live longer than 
        physical keepsakes or memories, if I attatch pictures using the camera I found from 2005, and write well, I can look back years 
        from now and relive these memories. At the end of the video, the creator said, "If you ever wanted to keep something, or have something 
        you want to share, just put it on the internet."
    </p>

    <h2>So that's what I did.</h2>

    

    <p>
        Instead of doing homework (although I did finish 1 assignment), I sat on the couch and coded this up. I may or may not continue to 
        actually use this, but I hope that I do, for my own sake in the future. I set up 4 categories for this "blog", "life", "projects", "fun", and "misc". 
        The life page is going to be used for more serious things, such as a post reflecting on high school, as an idea, or thoughts about going into 
        college next year. The projects page is something I've always wanted to do, and it's the first thing I thought of making after seeing 
        that video last night. I've made a lot of cool things over the years, and as time goes on I find it hard to remember all that I did, 
        so I want to have somewhere to document and take pictures and describe the inventions, school projects, car troubles, or anything else that 
        I think deserves to go into this category. 
    </p>

    <br/>

    <p>
        The "fun" and "misc" pages will probably be used less often, although I expect to post things about my friends and our fun times in /f, and 
        the more ****post-esque things in /j. I really am looking forward to using this "blog" more as time goes on, and I hope that I continue using 
        it so that I can look back in the future and enjoy my past.
    </p>
