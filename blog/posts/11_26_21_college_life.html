        so i'm in college now.

        and it's the best time of my life.

        It's been about 3 and a half months since I moved into 
        Purdue University. A lot has happened since I moved in, 
        and I'll try to remember as much as I can so strap in 
        this is gonna be a long post. I think. I'm actually 
        probably too lazy to write everything out so I'll just 
        hit the highlights.

        I live in Owen Hall, and despite the bad rap, I don't 
        actually think it's that bad. I can live with no A/C 
        and the room itself isn't that small. I'm able to fit 
        everything I need in it, my computer, piano keyboard, 
        the many clocks, and more! Owen is really close to 
        all of my classes, of which three are in Armstrong 
        hall of Engineering, about a 5 minute walk from home. 
        Ford Dining court is also really close, right across 
        the street from Owen, but the food there is mediocre 
        at best, so I don't often go there.

        I've made amazing friends since I've been here. 
        My friend Isabel (re - it's complicated) introduced 
        me to Lauren and Amaya, who live off campus but not 
        too far away, and from there a group was formed.
        They had met some people from their BGR (Boiler Gold Rush) 
        group, basically the week-long orientation thing, who 
        joined the group soon after. As time went on, we got 
        aquainted with more people and soon we had a pretty good 
        thing going on, an actual friend group that we all loved!
        We called ourselves

    <h2><i>Social Friction</i></h2>
    <p>insert logo here once i eventually make one</p>

    <br/>

    <p>
        Social Friction, a term coined by Aidan, defined as "the 
        inability to complete a task due to continuous talking with 
        one or more people or the inability to arrive at a destination 
        due to socially interacting with one or more people one runs 
        into on the way". Details can be found 
        <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=social%20friction">here</a>. 
        We get together pretty often throught each week, whether to study 
        together at Chaney, get dinner somewhere, or to party 
        at Lauren and Amaya's apartment. No matter what, we have 
        a good time when we're around each other and I couldn't 
        ask for better friends to start my college experience 
        with. 
    </p>

        My classes aren't too difficult as far as content goes, it's just
        there is a lot of work and it's literally impossible to stay 
        caught up. As I am writing this, I have about 8 hours of 
        lecture to watch and take notes over from the past 
        few weeks. My engineering class, ENGR 131 is mostly 
        business and project management, which I absolutely hate 
        and it makes me want to die, so I have to find fulfillment 
        through my speech teacher, Dr. Beasley. I don't really like 
        speech as a class but she makes the class so much fun because of 
        her style and personality, one times we skipped learning about 
        speech to do what the previous class in that room did, learn about 
        bones (She's an anthropologist by trade). Calculus 2 is terrible, 
        CHEM 115 is terrible, but I just deal with it. MSE 190 I haven't even 
        shown up to class in the last month, it's a throwaway class anyways.

        To keep myself sane, I've also been making stupid things. 
        I'll make posts about some of the things I've made in /p 
        when I have more time. We love 3AM motivation to work on the 
        website don't we. Not even coffee-fueled rage that's making 
        me do this. Anyways, I've made a 6 foot long longboard I call 
        "The Long<u>er</u>board" that has gotten some attention around 
        campus through the Purdue Longboarding Club and just random people 
        taking pictures of it. It does look pretty stupid in comparison 
        to actual skateboards. I just took the penny board I've had in my 
        attic for 10 years, took the trucks off, and stuck it on a plank of wood 
        I bought from menards. It actually works pretty well. I also made 
        The Bomb. It's not an actual bomb, probably. At least for legal 
        reasons it's not. I have an old lead-acid battery from the high school 
        that I needed something to do with, so I thought I would make a 
        portable charger with it. I wanted to give it a steampunk look, 
        so I bought a bunch of wood and brass and have since been building it. 
        As of right now, I'm not actually done, so I'll post about that after. 
        Those are the major things, but I've made a goal to do something 
        stupid like that every week I'm here. It's actually been pretty 
        reasonable to stick to that, only missing one or two weeks since I 
        got here. 
    </p>

        I think that's all I really have to say tonight, but I really have been 
        loving my time at Purdue and I am so excited to see where this goes. 
        I've had a ton of fun, learned a lot, and developed relationships I hope 
        never go away. If anyone in Social Friction is reading this, know you are 
        appreciated and I love each and every one of you for being my friend. 
        Alright, gushy stuff over, I love college and I'll probably post about 
        anything interesting that happens over the course of the four years I'll 
        be here.
